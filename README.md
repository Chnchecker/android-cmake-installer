# android-cmake-installer

Install CMake with proper configuration for Android projects

# Usage
To install the CMake ready for Android development:
```bash
wget https://github.com/Commit451/android-cmake-installer/releases/download/1.0.0/install-cmake.sh
chmod +x install-cmake.sh
./install-cmake.sh
```
This assumes that the `ANDROID_HOME` is set already in your path.

# Example
This script is currently used in [PixelAdjuster](https://github.com/Commit451/PixelAdjuster) if you want to see a full setup.
